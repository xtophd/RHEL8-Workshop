= Preface

This guide is intended to support a series of workshop exercises for individuals getting familiar with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

NOTE:  This whole effort is done using official Red Hat software and although things can likely be set up to work with upstream software components (Fedora, CentOS, etc...), alternate deritives of RHEL are not tested or validated with these exercises at this time.

= Conventions Used

== Tips, Notes & Warnings

TIP: Extra info which could be helpful, but not essential for a given task or discussion

NOTE: Special information to pay attention

WARNING: Critical information which could help you avoid major set backs

== Executing tasks on the CLI

=== Input

Each block of commands to execute will be label with the expected *user-id* and *host*.  To enhance cut & paste efficiency, the command prompt is omitted from each line.

.[root@master ~]#
----
systemctl status sshd
----

=== Output

Sample output will be titled with _'Your output should look like this'_ and also be indented to help with visual identification.  Sometimes there will also be footnotes and/or callouts.

.Your output should look like this
[source,indent=4]

=== Alternate Commands

The workshop often provides scripts to ease certain tasks and reduce the chance for errors.  This helps the class stay on task and reduces the likelyhood of disruption to the workshop delivery.  The native commands which the scripts utilize will be documented in the following way.

.[root@master ~]#
----
cheat-validate-service.sh
----

[NOTE]
====
_Native command(s) to verify POD service_
----
oc get services

curl http://{ip_address}}:8080

== Executing tasks in the WebUI

Notice that key value pairs for data entry are presented in a matrix.

____
select `Create Project` from *My Projects* on the *Openshift Landing* page

.Use following details for Create Project
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui
*Display Name*:: Hello WebUI
*Description*:: My First WebUI App

select `Create`

== Using CUT & PASTE For CLI Exercises

The official supported method of participation with this workshop is to use the provided console using a tool called "Shell In a Box".  This tool provides an SLL encrypted SSH session via your web browser.  If it hasn't been mentioned before, Chrome is the preferred browser.

Using CUT & PASTE from this guides to the console is highly recommended and should work.

[NOTE]
====
_Cut & Paste with Linux Desktop_
----
CUT: Select Text with Mouse
PASTE: Center Mouse Click (or possibly a Chorded Mouse Click)
----
====

[NOTE]
====
_Cut & Paste with Windows Desktop_
----
CUT: Select Text with Mouse and then CTL+C
PASTE: Select Browser Window and then CTL+SHIFT+V

I have found that adding a 'space' after the PASTE command works nicely.

== Using SCREEN for CLI Exercises

The `screen` utility can be very useful in workshop settings and is highly recommended.  It provides two key capabilities for us here:

    . Session Persistance
    ** If your ssh/siab connection is dropped or reset, you can resume the session after reconnecting.  Nothing is interrupted or lost.
    . Session Sharing
    ** An administration can join your session and shared the input/output.  This is particularly helpful in workshops utilizing remote options (ex: webex, bluejeans, etc...)

To enable a `screen` session simply execute the following.

.[student@workstation ~]#
----
screen -m
----

And now just continue as normal.

[NOTE]
====
_Additional tips on using 'screen'_
----

# list available sessions
screen -ls

# resume disconnected session
screen -r {name}

# disconnect current session
screen -d {name}

# to join a session (multiuser)
screen -x {name}

#To enable multi user on active session
ctrl-a :multiuser on

#To add an additional screen/shell
ctrl-a C

#To switch to Next screen/shell
ctrl-a N

#To review/navigate output history (use arrow keys, hit ESC to end)
ctrl-a ESC

#To Split Screen Horizontally
ctrl-a S

#To Move Cursor to other Split-Screen
ctrl-a TAB

#Kill all windows and terminate screen
ctl-a \
