= Web Console

Web Console is a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 web-based interface designed for managing and monitoring your local system, as well as Linux servers located in your network environment.

  * Managing services
  * Managing user accounts
  * Managing and monitoring system services
  * Configuring network interfaces and firewall
  * Reviewing system logs
  * Managing virtual machines
  * Creating diagnostic reports
  * Setting kernel dump configuration
  * Configuring SELinux
  * Updating software
  * Managing system subscriptions

The following exercises will walk you through installing and configuring Web Console on RHEL 8. 

== Getting Started

Since we already have web-console installed and active on *workstation.example.com*, we have the option to manage multiple additional hosts via this single portal.  Let's install a few packages to enable the web-console dashboard on *workstation.example.com*.  These steps needs to be performed as root.

.[root@workstation]#
----
yum install -y cockpit-dashboard
----

Once the packages are installed, you will need to restart the cockpit services to enable the new functionality.

.[root@workstation]#
----
systemctl restart cockpit
----

This will likely force you to sign-on to the web console again.

Click the icon on the left that looks like a speedometer.

Now click on the *+* icon to add *node2.example.com* to the list of servers we can manage with this web-console.

Now click on *node2.example.com* in the server list to start with this lab.

== Installation and Configuraiton

=== Packages and Services

For your convenience, the webconsole has already been installed and configured on *node2.example.com*.  The steps are pretty simple and outlined below.  Remember this provided as reference only as they were executed during the ansible play of prep-rhel8-workshop.

[NOTE]
====
_Native command(s) to install and enable firewalld_
----
yum install -y cockpit
systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
----
====

== Web Console User Interface

NOTE: If you are usng the web-console on *workstation.example* with your local browser, you do not need to access the GUI console.

On host *workstation.example.com*, use the console GUI to start a web browser.

Then browse to URL: `https://node2.example.com:9090`
Login userID: root  Password: <ROOT-PASSWD>

Here is a simple dashboard where you can monitor current system activities:

  * CPU utilization
  * Memory Utilization
  * Disk I/O
  * Network traffic

== Enable Persistent Metrics

To enable persistent metrics, Web Console requires “Performance Co-pilot (pcp)” and cockpit pcp plugin. Follow the screenshots to install and enable persistent metrics.

Use the Web Console -> Terminal to install a couple of packages and restart the Web Console socket.

.[root@node2]#
----
yum install -y cockpit-pcp
systemctl restart cockpit.socket
----

NOTE: When the socket is restarted, your Web Console connection will reset and require you to login again.

NOTE: You should also refresh your broswer for the option `Store metric` to be visible.

Now enable persistent metrics.

== Change Performance Profile

RHEL 8 comes with several pre-canned performance tuning profiles from Tuned. Since this is a virtual machine, the default profile “virtual-guest” was selected. You can easily switch profile via the Web Console web UI. In this exercise, we will change the profile to “throughput-performance”

== View Logs

Under the log section, you can review past and current log events and log severity

== Network Management

Under the networking section, you can monitor current networking activities. You can create network bond, team, bridge, and vlan driven by GUI

====

Also under the networking section, you can configure your firewall rules. In the following example, you will find and enable NTP firewall rule.

====

Now that NTP firewall rule is enabled. Let’s make sure NTP service is enabled and running under the service section

== Service Management

Web Console also allows you to start/stop, restart, enable/disable a service on your RHEL 8 server:

This concludes a short exercise with Web Console. Feel free to click through and explore other sections:

* Under *Accounts* section, you can manage user accounts on your RHEL 8 server
* *Diagnostic Reports* allows you to create sosreport for Red Hat support
* Under *Kernel Dump*, you can enable/disable kdump
