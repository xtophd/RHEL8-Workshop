= Workshop Environment Preparation

== Sign-On on to your *workstation* session

Using the connection information and credentials provided by the instructor, get yourselves signed into your workstation session.

== Invoke *tmux* Session

*tmux* is a very handy utilty for terminal session management.  If for any reason you lose connectivity or your session is terminated, *tmux* will preserve your session and allow you to reconnect.  There are MANY other features provided by this utility.  Some of them are listed on the front page section titled *tmux*.
