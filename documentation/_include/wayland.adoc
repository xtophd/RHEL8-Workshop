= Wayland

[NOTE]
====
The graphical desktop is disabled by default to improve the overall performance of this workshop in the public cloud.  If you have access to the console, as the root user you can switch-on the graphical desktop with 'systemctl isolate'.  Make the change permanent with 'systemctl set-default' option.

_Enable the Graphical Desktop_
----
systemctl isolate graphical.target

systemctl set-default graphical.target

== About Wayland

Wayland is a compositor protocol and library implementation of that protocol.  Wayland replaces the legacy X11 protocol with the primary benefit being that it is easier to develop and maintain.  Meaning, Wayland drops many of the X11 specifications that are no longer in use.

That said, Wayland also enables features that are hard or impossible to support under X:

  * input transformation
  * transparent hardware overlays
  * direct rendering
  * isolating clients (sandboxing)
  * ... and plenty more ( link:https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland[GNOME Wiki Wayland] )

Wayland was born and raised in the X community, and has strong support.

First introduced to the Fedora community back in version 25, Wayland has been under developemnt for several years before it's introduction in RHEL 8.   Wayland is the new standard in graphical desktop environments. 

For more information, see the resources listed below.

NOTE:  X11 is still shipped with RHEL 8, but requires manual installation as it is not the default installed compsitor protocol

== Installation & Configuration

=== Packages and Services

The graphical desktop is included by default in a "Workstation" installation of RHEL 8, but this is not the case in a "Server" installation.

For today’s lab this has already been done for you. In the event you installed a text based RHEL 8 host on your own, you can load and enable Wayland with the following simple steps:

[NOTE]
====
_Native command(s) to install Wayland_
----
yum groupinstall Workstation
 
systemctl set-default graphical

reboot
----
====

Please proceed to log into the GUI console of *workstation.example.com* as the user *student*.  The password should be provided by your instructor.

== Customizing the Desktop

After successfully signing in as *student*, you should notice that you have an amazingly clean desktop as shown below.

Let us begin our exploration of Wayland by customizing a few things.  

First, we will configure your desktop to have a menu system.

====

____
Click -> `Activities` near the top left corner

Click -> `Activities Overview` near the bottom left
____

====
image::wayland-110-tweaks-appmenu.png[Application Menu]
====

Now that we are back on the *Activities Overview* page, we search for a package.

____
In the *Search Bar* near the top center, enter the following:

[horizontal]
*Search*:: firewall
____

The search will result in a link to the package installer.

____
Click -> `Firewall Configuration`
____

====
image::wayland-30-firewall-search.png[Firewall Search]
====

This will bring up the Gnome Software package installation GUI along with a description of the utility.  Now let us proceed with installation.

____
Click -> `Firewall`
____

====
image::wayland-40-firewall-description.png[Firewall Description]
====

Now you are on the details page of the utlity.  You can scroll down and read more about the tool, see reviews and ratings.  Time to install the Firewall Configuration tool.


____
Click -> `Install`
____
  
====
image::wayland-50-firewall-install.png[Firewall Install]
====

Now that it is installed, proceed to launch the tool and explore the firewall configuration.

____

====
image::wayland-60-firewall-launch.png[Firewall Install]
====

You’ll be prompted for the password for student - enter the password.  Because the user *student* is a member of the *wheel* group, you will be able to perform most administrator tasks.

====

Feel free to browse the interface but don’t make any changes.  When you are done exploring close the Firewall Configuration tool

____
Click -> X in the titlebar
